# Exercise-Yoga-Detection-YOLOv8
Fitness monitoring system using body pose estimation to count repetitions of exercises like push-ups, jumping jacks, curl-ups, and squats. Tracks yoga pose durations and include an alert for animal detection in the exercise area, ensuring safety and accuracy in real-time using YOLOv*8.

# AI Zenith (AIZ) - Exercise Count & Yoga Pose Detection

## Project Overview
AI Zenith (AIZ) is a sophisticated machine learning project that combines exercise repetition counting with yoga pose detection using YOLOv8. The system's primary objective is to detect and count repetitions of common exercises like push-ups, jumping jacks, curl-ups, and squats by recognizing human body movements through Body Pose Estimation technology. Additionally, it classifies yoga poses, tracks the duration of each pose, and includes a safety feature that alerts users if a pet enters the exercise space to prevent accidents.
